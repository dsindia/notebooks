    "In our last notebook, we learned how to use the power of programming to visualize data. But that's not all we can do with these Python libraries. Today we'll take our programming toolkit one step further and see how we can use the same libraries to calculate numerical information about our data after we've plotted it. Visualizations and numerical information together can tell us  detailed stories about our data and what it means.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by using matplotlib - the same library we used to make line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts - to explore the process of visualizing data using scatter plots. We'll then see how we can use another powerful library called numpy to numerically investigate the relationships between variables in our data by computing correlation coefficients. Finally we'll also look into plotting lines of best fit as an introduction to the concept of regression."

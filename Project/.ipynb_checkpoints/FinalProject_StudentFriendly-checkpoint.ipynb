We must understand the difference between an acquittal and a false case - no matter the crime. An acquittal occurs when there is not enough proof against the accused - not necessarily when the accuser is determined to be a liar. In fact, the acquittal rate for all crimes is approximately the same. The rate of acquittal for attempted murder for example is 73.4%. That doesn’t mean there is a false murder case epidemic! For rape it is 72.9%. So perhaps we should not have looked at the acquittal rate data to assess the conviction rate. What other types of data do you think we could have looked at to help us?*\n"

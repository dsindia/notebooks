The function contains instructions used to create the output from its input.\n",

    "The numpy package provides us with convenient functions for creating and manipulating arrays. Some examples include np.prod,which multiplies all the elements together and np.sum which adds all the elements together. Both of these functions take in an array as their argument and return a single value. We also have functions that take in arrays as arguments and return arrays of values. Examples include np.diff, which computes the difference between adjacent elements and np.round which rounds each element to the nearest whole number.\n",
